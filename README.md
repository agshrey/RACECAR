# RACECAR üèé
These are all the files for the MIT BWSI Racecar Course, including solutions to all labs and a full run of the final grand prix race. These algorithms were developed in 2022, but are only being published now.

## About ‚ÑπÔ∏è
Using a simulated car in Unity, this algorithm uses the different sensors on the car, including a camera, depth sensor, and 2D LIDAR, to sense its surrounding environment and navigate around obstacles. Various control theory and machine learning concepts were explored, including Color, Image, and Depth Processing, State Machines, PID Control, Gaussian Blurs, AR Markers, IMUs, and Kalman Filters

## File Structure üìÅ
This repository is split into labs and final project files. There are multiple versions of some of the labs, as that includes optimizations after initially completing the labs.

## Example Video üì∏
Here is an example of how the algorithm performed on one leg of the full grand prix course.
